An RNA-binding protein secreted by a bacterial pathogen modulates RIG-I signaling
Cell Host and Microbes, In Press

Abstract:
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) perform key cellular activities by controlling the function of
bound RNAs. The widely held assumption that RBPs are strictly intracellular has been
challenged by the discovery of secreted RBPs. However, extracellular RBPs have been described
in eukaryotes while secreted bacterial RBPs have not been reported. Here, we show that the
bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes secretes a small RBP that we named Zea. We show
that Zea binds a subset of L. monocytogenes RNAs causing their accumulation in the
extracellular medium. Furthermore, during L. monocytogenes infection, Zea binds RIG-I, the
non-self-RNA innate immunity sensor, potentiating interferon  production. Mouse infection
studies reveal that Zea affects L. monocytogenes virulence. Together, our results unveil that
bacterial RNAs can be present extracellularly in association with RBPs, acting as “social RNAs”
to trigger a host response during infection.
